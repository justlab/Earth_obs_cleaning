# AOD_CONUS
ML AOD CONUS 2019


The drake plan takes __`AOD_CONUS_Report.Rmd`__ and generate html report. I suggest download the repo locally to open the html report: 

```{r}
git clone https://github.com/justlab/AOD_CONUS.git
```
  
The __R/__ folder contains all the other code.
  
The drake plan for CONUS is __`R/drake_plan_conus.Rmd`__. The `drake_funcs.R` contains all the functions used in the drake plan. 
  
The __R/non_drake_code_and_md_files/__ folder contains older code, including `03.2` about Aeronet stations AOD variation and `plot_predicted_aod470.Rmd` which plots AOD470nm interpolation/exterpolation.
